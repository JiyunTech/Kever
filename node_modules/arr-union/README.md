# arr-union [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/arr-union.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/arr-union)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/arr-union.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/arr-union) 

> Combines a list of arrays, returning a single array with unique values, using strict equality for comparisons.

You can do this with just `[].concat.apply([], arguments)`, like [array-union](https://github.com/sindresorhus/array-union) but this implementation is much faster and more peformant. 

For the most common use cases, this library is **20 times faster** than array-union. 

```bash
#1: five-arrays.js
  array-union.js x 289,891 ops/sec ±0.70% (97 runs sampled)
  current.js x 5,429,077 ops/sec ±0.81% (93 runs sampled)

#2: ten-arrays.js
  array-union.js x 161,132 ops/sec ±0.72% (98 runs sampled)
  current.js x 1,725,939 ops/sec ±0.61% (97 runs sampled)

#3: two-arrays.js
  array-union.js x 376,238 ops/sec ±0.83% (95 runs sampled)
  current.js x 6,817,593 ops/sec ±0.63% (94 runs sampled)
```
See the [benchmarks](./benchmark).


## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i arr-union --save
```

## Usage

```js
var last = require('array-last');

union(['a'], ['b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']);
//=> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

Returns only unique elements:

```js
union(['a', 'a'], ['b', 'c']);
//=> ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## Other array utilities
* [arr-diff](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/arr-diff): Returns an array with only the unique values from the first array, by excluding all values from additional arrays using strict equality for comparisons.
* [arr-flatten](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/arr-flatten): Recursively flatten an array or arrays. This is the fastest implementation of array flatten.
* [arr-filter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/arr-filter): Faster alternative to javascript's native filter method.
* [arr-map](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/arr-map): Faster, node.js focused alternative to JavaScript's native array map.
* [arr-pluck](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/arr-pluck): Retrieves the value of a specified property from all elements in the collection.
* [arr-reduce](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/arr-reduce): Fast array reduce that also loops over sparse elements.
* [array-unique](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/array-unique): Return an array free of duplicate values. Fastest ES5 implementation.
